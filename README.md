A quick **guide** (or a **cheatsheet**) on how to make advanced google searches with search operators and narrow down your search results to find exactly what you want.

> Math jargons are used here for examples

#### Specifying a website:

```
calculus site:math-website.com
```

With `site:` prefix, your search will include results only for the site you specify.


#### Using quotation marks for exact results:

```
'calculus'
```

Quotes will get you results that include exactly what you typed inside of it and in the exact order you typed the words in. You could also use quotes to find results that may be within a desired time range. For example:

```
'calculus 1999..2011'
```

This way by using *'(start_year)..(end_year)'* you're signifying that you want the search results that were published between that time range.


#### AND/OR:

```
calculus AND trigonometry
```

`AND` operator returns search results that has to be related to both the search terms you enter. Also you can obviously include multiple `AND`s in your search or combine it with other operators.

```
calculus OR trigonometry
```

`OR` operator returns searches that might be related to both the search terms or either one of them.


#### Specifying a file type:

```
calculus101 filetype:pdf
```

for a specific file type to include in your search results, like a pdf file or a xml file or docx file or any file type really, you can signify with the `filetype:` prefix.
